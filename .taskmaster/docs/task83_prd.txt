# Product Requirements Document: Monorepo Structure Design

## Overview
Design a comprehensive monorepo structure for the Resume Velvit Thunder project based on the audit findings from Task 82. The structure should improve code organization, facilitate code sharing, and support future growth.

## Objectives
1. Create a clear and scalable directory structure
2. Establish consistent naming conventions
3. Plan for shared resources between frontend and backend
4. Document the migration path from current to new structure

## Requirements

### 1. Directory Structure
- `/apps` - Contains all applications
  - `/api` - Backend API service
  - `/web` - Frontend application
- `/packages` - Shared packages
  - `/shared` - Shared utilities and libraries
  - `/config` - Shared configuration
  - `/types` - Shared TypeScript types
- `/scripts` - Build, deployment, and utility scripts
- `/docs` - Project documentation
  - `/api` - API documentation
  - `/guides` - User and developer guides
  - `/architecture` - System architecture documents
- `/tests` - Test files
  - `/unit` - Unit tests
  - `/integration` - Integration tests
  - `/e2e` - End-to-end tests
  - `/__fixtures__` - Test fixtures
- `/tools` - Development tools and configurations
- `/config` - Global configuration files

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for directory and file names
- Prefix test files with `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*`
- Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose
- Keep file and directory names short but meaningful

### 3. Migration Planning
- Create a detailed mapping of current to new file locations
- Identify files that can be deleted or archived
- Plan for shared resources between frontend and backend
- Document any special handling required for complex moves

### 4. Shared Resources
- Identify and plan for shared TypeScript types/interfaces
- Create a strategy for sharing utilities and constants
- Document the process for adding new shared resources

## Success Criteria
- Clear and consistent directory structure
- Comprehensive migration plan
- Documentation of naming conventions and standards
- Plan for shared resources between frontend and backend
- Minimal disruption to existing development workflow
