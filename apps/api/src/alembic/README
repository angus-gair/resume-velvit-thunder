# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Creating a New Migration

To create a new migration after making changes to your models:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

## Applying Migrations

To apply all pending migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Reverting Migrations

To revert the last migration:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Checking Current Revision

To check the current database revision:

```bash
alembic current
```

## Migration Workflow

1. Make changes to your SQLAlchemy models in `api/database/models.py`
2. Generate a migration script: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message"`
3. Review the generated migration script in `alembic/versions/`
4. Apply the migration: `alembic upgrade head`

## Important Notes

- Always review autogenerated migration scripts before applying them
- Never edit migration files that have already been applied to production
- Keep your migration scripts under version control
- Test migrations in a development environment before applying to production
