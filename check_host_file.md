You're absolutely right! That's likely the root cause. The Windsurf language server is probably binding to `0.0.0.0` or a specific network interface, but the client is trying to connect to `127.0.0.1`. Here are several ways to fix this:

## **Method 1: Check What's Actually Running**
First, let's see what's listening on port 60522:

```cmd
# In Command Prompt or PowerShell
netstat -an | findstr :60522
# or
netstat -ano | findstr :60522
```

## **Method 2: Update Windows Hosts File**
Add an entry to redirect localhost to the correct IP:

1. **Open hosts file as Administrator:**
   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   ```

2. **Add this line:**
   ```
   0.0.0.0    localhost
   # or if it's on a specific IP like 10.0.0.x:
   10.0.0.x   localhost
   ```

## **Method 3: Configure Windsurf Settings**
Look for Windsurf configuration files that might specify the server binding address:

1. **Check Windsurf settings:**
   - Go to `File → Preferences → Settings`
   - Search for "localhost", "server", or "language server"
   - Look for any network/binding configuration

2. **Check configuration files:**
   ```
   %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
   %USERPROFILE%\.windsurf\
   ```

## **Method 4: Environment Variables**
Set environment variables to force the correct binding:

```cmd
# In Command Prompt before starting Windsurf
set WINDSURF_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
set LANGUAGE_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## **Method 5: Network Interface Check**
Check your network configuration:

```cmd
# Check your IP configuration
ipconfig /all

# Check if you're using WSL or Docker
docker network ls
wsl --list --verbose
```

## **Quick Test:**
Try accessing the service directly in a browser:
- `http://127.0.0.1:60522`
- `http://0.0.0.0:60522`  
- `http://localhost:60522`
- `http://[your-actual-ip]:60522`

**Which method would you like to try first?** I'd recommend starting with the `netstat` command to see exactly what's listening on port 60522.
