I often work concurrently on various projects at different stages of development, and I've found that having, and strictly following, a solid framework like Agile methodology and using project management tools such as JIRA helps keep these projects on track."

## Selection Criteria Responses

### Criterion 1: SQL Skills and Analytics Tools

"I hold a demonstrated history of using SQL on a daily basis throughout the past seven years. This includes large datasets for Domino's Pizza, Mastercard and HSBC at a transactional level with records exceeding 100 million. In addition to this, I also assisted Equifax Credit Bureau at an individual level with more than 25 million records, which required a degree of query optimisation. More recently, I worked with Woolworths on the rebuild of the store Planning and Performance Dashboard. Amongst the abundance of query, data modelling and data collection, this process leveraged several key systems such as SQL, Python and Google App Script. Throughout this process, I managed data definitions and collections, ETL process and data model through to creating dashboard reports and insights. This project was well received by stakeholders as it allowed them to effectively forecast future sales and wage demand.
 
Additionally, though my time at Prospa as a Business Intelligence Analyst, I was responsible for SQL query writing alongside data transformation and modelling. My hands-on capability in analytics tools like SAS is demonstrated in my successful completion of a 5-day workshop at SAS headquarters in Melbourne, which awarded me the "Getting Started and Predictive Modelling Using SAS InMemory Statistics Course" and "Predictive Modelling Using SAS High-Performance Analytics Procedures Course" certifications."

### Criterion 2: Understanding Business Processes and Data Relationships

"Throughout my recent career as a contractor, I have further developed my ability to join project teams and quickly understand how the business operates in terms of business processes, ways of work, team structure and the appropriate people to approach for better understanding each requirement. As I am employed in these projects as a contractor to one day hand over my work to BAU processes, it is part of my responsibilities to ensure each process is well documented to allow for easy and seamless transitions into the next phase of the project. Holding a solid history as a BI Analyst, a large part of my roles have been centred around data and how it was both extracted and merged between systems to define the meta data.

In terms of understanding complex data relationships and business rules, I have held many positions relevant to this within companies such as Equifax, Prospa, Mastercard and Woolworths. This experience allowed me to work with a wide range of complex datasets that could be linked together, though required a deep understanding of data types and structure in order to link them on multiple joining keys and levels of granularity. For example, we get rosters from Kronos systems, which need to be merged with employee data from WorkIam, wages from Sap and then overlaid with business KPI's based on varies GCP databases. These databases contain sales, transactions, Voice of Customer and sales forecasts. These datasets are at a transactional level – daily and hourly – while others are slowly changing dimensional tables."

### Criterion 3: Assisting External Teams with Data Analysis

"As previously mentioned above, my past and current contracting positions have required me to get up to speed quickly on the structure of an organisation's Data Warehouses, while maintaining a solid understanding throughout the duration of my employment. This allowed me to broaden my knowledge on typical Data Warehouses used in different businesses and situations, along with the best means to navigate them. Through my time at Equifax, I have been employed as a Senior member of the team, which required me to pass on crucial and important knowledge that would further assist junior team members in working within best practice and important business requirements. This came naturally to me in terms of communicating, both written and verbally, with others in order to better understand all of the key information they may require.

My background is in data analysis, which gives me a strong insight into the type of required information and the optimal format the company would require it. Additionally, in my previously mentioned role of Business Intelligence Analyst with Prospa, I was required to initiate, build and maintain key contacts both internally and externally to the organisation, which allowed for ease of navigation in SAS for their data analysis."

### Criterion 4: Identifying Stakeholders and Clarifying Business Concepts

"My current position as Senior Tableau Developer with Woolworths requires me to speak with the end users, such as Head of Finance, to better understand their reporting requirements and subsequently document these data requirements to further assist the data developers in integrating the solution and data model into the Data Warehouse. Part of this role is to understand and translate end user requirements into an actionable item for data developers. For example, the end user wanted to visualise the store's roster as a chart rather than a table. It was my responsibility to translate that request into a data requirement and create the "labour demand line" as a visual chart. 

When I build a Business Intelligence report / dashboard, I use the agile framework; Design, Build, Test and Review. Review is a critical part of the process as it allows the stakeholders to have the ability to start using end products and make refinements along the way. Collaboration is important as the end product will always be more fit for purpose rather than creating a solution in a 'Silo'. Throughout the projects completed within this role, I maintained date integrity and stable dashboard performance, which allowed key decisions to be made regarding program rollout, leading to continual improvement of auto schedulers and rostering efficiency."

### Criterion 5: Data Warehousing and Data Modeling

"Throughout my daily use working with data, I have built an extensive knowledge of data warehousing concepts. My contracting experience allowed me to further develop my understanding of best practice, as I worked in various start-ups, FinTech's credit card companies and supermarkets. I have learned firsthand best practices from reputable and high quality organisations.

During my time at Society One, I was part of the team that built the Data Marts for reporting. This involved moving raw data from production, which contained many tables (Snow Flake Schema) through an integrated ETL process that simplified the data into a simple star schema that was ready for analysts to consume for reporting. As I was a junior on the team at the time, the majority of my work included testing data by querying tables to ensure accuracy between raw data layers, staging, business layers and DataMart. In addition to this, I was responsible for testing business logic and writing queries for marketing reporting including direct mail campaigns, board level reporting and customer service reports. Since then, I have implemented the principles of Data warehousing (keys, indexes, joins, cleansing) on a regular basis.

Additionally, I have a personal interest in geo-spatial data and wanted to expand my skills in my spare time. I turned my home PC into a SQL server and built a data warehouse from the ground up. Leveraging data from G-NAF (Geoscape Geocoded National Address File) from data.gov.au and overlaying demographic variables from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). I created a visual dashboard of Australia that was more granular than a postcode (Meshblock) that listed all ABS statistics in order to generate profiles of geographical areas."

### Criterion 6: Organizing and Cleansing Data

"Over the past 10 years that I have been doing analytics, I have discovered that the accuracy and quality of the insights that you get from a model is largely dependent on the quality and relevancy of the data feeding into the model.

During my time working as a Data Scientist at Equifax I was required to build a predictive model for the Australian Labor Party. My role as the Senior/Lead on the project was to organize the junior analysts in collating all the data from various sources into a single table that would be used to build the model. Data sources included:
- Phone Polling responses (CSV formats)
- Household geo-demographic data (SQL)
- Past Year polling data (JSON)

My role included:
- Quality Control (QC) to ensure that all the data was accurate
- Documenting and Cataloging code scripts via GIT (for SQL and R languages)
- Data matching in SQL
- Providing Guidance as to structure of the data (for example prorating the data down to a household level or rolling up individual data to a household) 

Results: Successfully delivered a single data model that represented every household in Australia (approximately 10 million)."

### Criterion 7: Communication Skills for Understanding Data Requirements

"Having worked as a contractor for some time, I have developed strong communications skills around data as it is an essential requirement to be able to hit the ground running on projects and be able to anticipate where the problem areas are likely to arise and be able to solve these issues ahead of time.

In my current role I have been responsible for Costing of the Train Networks Timetables. This is a complex piece of work that requires a deep understanding of Procedural Requirements (the process of creating rosters), Legal Requirements (Enterprise Bargaining Agreements) and System (technology) requirements. Throughout the course of the project I built strong relationships with key stakeholders from Train Crewing (staff rostering), Payroll and ICT. 

During the project there were many data issues along the way, from; how to deal with multiple or conflicting pay entitlements, special cases not outlined in the Enterprise Agreement, discrepancies in data between different source systems. Through these relationships I built, I was able to "extract" years of very specialized knowledge from these individuals to solve these issues and document (and code) the process from end-to-end for the first time."

### Criterion 8: Analyzing Data to Find Business Answers

"I have had over 6 years experience in analytics within a consulting capacity (Equifax, MediaCom and OMD). During this time have been exposed to a wide range of data analytics methodologies such as Statistical Analysis (Regression, Population Analysis, Exploratory / ANOVA) and Machine Learning (Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosted Machines and clustering techniques). These techniques were applied to answer questions such as; What Media Channels have the highest ROI? Which individuals across Australia are most likely to become AMEX customers? And Which households have the greatest propensity to vote Labor at the next federal election?

The largest project that I have on is New Site Recommendations for Domino's Pizza. In order to accomplish this I was required to build a data set that comprised of Household Demographics, Commercial Demographics and Business Sales Data. I then created new variables, such as; Average distance of delivery, Cost of Goods and Break Even distance. Using this dataset I then built two models that forecasted Sales for Pickup and Sales of Delivery. 

Using the insights learned from the analysis I was then able to recommend the next top 100 sites for new locations, which stores needed to reduce their store territory size and which stores were underperforming. The project was a success and we then rolled out the framework for Domino's New Zealand, Netherlands and France."

### Criterion 9: Teamwork and Adaptability

"Having worked as a contractor for some time, I am able to adapt quickly to new environments and ways of working in order to meet business and project expectations. I thrive in fast paced and changing environments, and have a reputation for hitting the ground running to deliver exceptional results. This requires me to maintain a range of skills including creative problem solving, communication, workload prioritization and collaboration. I have always worked well in cohesive team environments, and have maintained long-term professional relationships with the people I have worked with.

During my time at Equifax, I led a team during a transition into the agile methodology way of organizing work. This transition proved to be very successful with the rollout leading to an increased number of projects completed by the team within timelines, budget and quality expectations. This was achieved by the team and myself by embracing change and prioritizing conflicting workloads throughout the project life-cycle. Additionally, this position required me to formulate the team vision and objective in line with business strategy. I connected team members to strategic requirements through regular communication and delegation, and assisted with my team member's career management including goal setting and ensuring each staff member was on the path to achieving their professional long-term goals."

### Criterion 10: Dashboard Creation for Business Decisions

"This can be seen through my time at Woolworths as a Senior Tableau Developer where I worked on two major dashboard projects. With the 'Implementation Review Dashboard', I analyzed the effectiveness of rolling out the auto-scheduler and collated information for three major groups; Store Manager, Group Manager and Program Stakeholders while taking into account their individual needs. This dashboard became the source of truth for program performance and was used by all key decision makers within the project team. With such a strong importance placed on data integrity, the auto-scheduler continuously improved to reduce rostering costs. Additionally, I participated in the re-build of the store Planning and Performance Dashboard as the most used dashboard within Retail Analytics with hundreds of users visiting the report daily."
