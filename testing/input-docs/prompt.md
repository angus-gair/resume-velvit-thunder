First, review the job listing:

<job_listing>
{{JOB_LISTING}}
</job_listing>

Next, examine the comprehensive "mega resume" that contains all work experience, skills, and project details:

<mega_resume>
{{MEGA_RESUME}}
</mega_resume>

Review the projects organized by skill category:

<projects_by_category>
{{PROJECTS_BY_CATEGORY}}
</projects_by_category>

Consider my detailed responses to common selection criteria and key skills:

<skills_and_criteria>
{{SKILLS_AND_CRITERIA}}
</skills_and_criteria>

Finally, here is the resume template to be filled out:

<resume_template>
{{RESUME_TEMPLATE}}
</resume_template>

Now, follow these steps to create a tailored resume:

1. Analyze the job listing:
   - Identify key requirements, skills, and experiences that the employer is seeking.
   - Make a list of the most important qualifications for the position.

2. Select relevant experience from the mega resume:
   - mst include the following roles: "AJ Insights"", "WooliesX", "Sydney Trains", "Woolworths Group", "Equifax"
   - You can choose to add roles from "Prospa" and "Mastercard" if relevant.
   - Choose projects that best demonstrate alignment with the job requirements (any role avaiable)
   - Focus on the most recent and relevant experiences.
   - Ensure reverse chronological order.

3. Choose relevant projects:
   - Select specific projects from the projects_by_category that highlight relevant skills and accomplishments for the position.
   - Prioritize projects that demonstrate the key skills identified in the job listing.

4. Tailor skills and experiences:
   - Use the skills_and_criteria to craft concise descriptions of relevant skills and experiences.
   - Quantify achievements whenever possible (e.g., "Increased efficiency by 25%") BUT DO NOT CREATE FALSE FIGURES.


5. Fill out the resume template:
   - Maintain the existing roles in the correct chronological order.
   - Modify the skills and experiences for each role to align with the specific job application.
   - Pay special attention to the skills listed in the right-hand column, tailoring them to match the requirements of the target position.
   - Ensure that the most relevant and impressive information is included while keeping the resume concise.

6. Review and format:
   - Ensure the resume is approximately 670 - 750 words long
   - Fit on 2 Pages where the page is Letter 8.5" x 11"
   - Check that the formatting is consistent and professional.
   - Proofread for any errors or inconsistencies.

When you have completed the tailored resume, present it within <tailored_resume> tags. Include a brief explanation of your choices and any challenges you encountered in creating the resume within <explanation> tags.
